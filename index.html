                            <p>Maintaining territorial databases, getting familiar with tools available at the laboratory: GIS, remote sensing, photogrammetry programs. Analysis of coastal erosion in the area of North-Western Sardinia with cartographical tools, GIS, GNSS capturing and DSAS plugin (Digital Shoreline Analysis System).
                            My  Master’s Thesis: “50 years of urban development in Sardinia. Forms and coastal erosion impacts” was  jointly  supervised  by  University  of  Luxembourg  and  University  of Sassari where I spent a 5 –month training period in the GIS Laboratory. In my research I investigate land  use  changes,  specifically  looking  at  urbanisation  process  that  occurred  in  the  period  between 1954  and  2008  for two cities  of Sardinia:  Cagliari  and  Sassari. My Thesis addresses also human impact,  specifically  urbanisation  impact on  shoreline  change in  both  coastal  areas.  This  research helped  me  to practice  explanatory  models  of  urbanisation processes and machine learning using R programming. An  important  part  of  the  research  is  a  land  use  classification  using  remote  sensing  tools such   as   ERDAS for ArcGIS   and   developing   knowledge   engineering   approach   for   panchromatic   image classification. I presented my research during a research  day at  University  of  Sassari „Urban forms in Sardinia. Segmentation methods in panchromatic picture classification”. </p>
